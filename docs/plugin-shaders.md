# Plugin shaders: view backgrounds (`shaders@0.1`)

A plugin can draw the background behind the model in the 3D view: a sky, a picture that turns with
the camera, rain on a window. It ships a small WGSL fragment shader as text. SolidCraft checks the
shader when the plugin is installed and again when it is drawn, wraps it in its own entry points
and bindings, caps how long any pixel may loop, and compiles it for the graphics card. If anything
fails, the theme's own background stays and the status bar says why.

A shader plugin needs no WebAssembly component and runs no code on the CPU. It can also live in
the same plugin as commands (`commands@0.1`). [RFC 0015, amendment 1](rfcs/0015-plugin-ui-workspaces.md#amendment-1-shaders-and-tools)
gives the design and the reasons for it.

## Using one

1. Install the plugin's `.zip` from Preferences › Plugins › Install plugin…, or with
   `plugin.install {"path": "dusk.zip"}`.
2. Pick it under Preferences › Interface › Background effect. The row appears once an installed,
   turned-on plugin offers a background.

The choice is the `background_shader` preference, `"<plugin-id>/<shader-id>"`, so a script or agent
sets it with `ui.prefs {"background_shader": "dusk/dusk"}`. `""` (the default) is none. Turning
the plugin off in Preferences › Plugins, or removing it, stops it being drawn.

The background is drawn over the theme's background and under the model, the grid and everything
else, like the Background picture preference. It is desktop only for now, as plugins are.

## Worked example 1: Dusk, a sky in the theme's colours

[`plugin-examples/dusk/`](plugin-examples/dusk/) holds two files.

`plugin.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "dusk",
  "name": "Dusk",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A sky in the theme's colours behind the model, with a glow drifting along the horizon.",
  "capabilities": ["shaders@0.1"],
  "shaders": [
    {
      "id": "dusk",
      "name": "Dusk",
      "kind": "background",
      "source": "dusk.wgsl",
      "animated": true
    }
  ]
}
```

`dusk.wgsl`:

```wgsl
fn background(px: ScPixel) -> vec4<f32> {
    // How far above the horizon this pixel looks: -1 straight down, 1 straight up.
    let height = px.ray.z;
    let sky = mix(sc.bottom.rgb, sc.top.rgb, smoothstep(-0.2, 0.6, height));
    // A band of the theme's accent just above the horizon, moving round it once a minute.
    let heading = atan2(px.ray.y, px.ray.x);
    let drift = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos(heading - sc.time * 6.2831853 / 60.0);
    let band = exp(-pow((height - 0.05) / 0.08, 2.0)) * mix(0.15, 0.4, drift);
    return vec4<f32>(mix(sky, sc.accent.rgb, band), 1.0);
}
```

Zip the two files (at the top of the `.zip`, or in one folder) and install the `.zip`. The sky
uses the theme's view colours and accent, so it suits light and dark themes alike, and the horizon
tilts as you orbit because it follows the world's Z axis.

## Worked example 2: Panorama, a picture that turns with the view

[`plugin-examples/panorama/`](plugin-examples/panorama/) adds a texture. Put a 360° picture
(equirectangular, twice as wide as tall, horizon across the middle) beside the files as
`panorama.jpg`.

```json
"shaders": [
  {
    "id": "panorama",
    "name": "Panorama",
    "kind": "background",
    "source": "panorama.wgsl",
    "textures": [{"name": "picture", "file": "panorama.jpg"}]
  }
]
```

```wgsl
const TAU: f32 = 6.2831853;
const PI: f32 = 3.1415927;

fn background(px: ScPixel) -> vec4<f32> {
    let ray = px.ray;
    let uv = vec2<f32>(atan2(ray.y, ray.x) / TAU + 0.5, 0.5 - asin(clamp(ray.z, -1.0, 1.0)) / PI);
    // Pick the mip level by hand: where u wraps from 1 back to 0 the GPU's own choice is a tiny
    // level and draws a seam.
    let texels = f32(textureDimensions(picture, 0).y);
    let view = 2.0 * atan(length(sc.up.xyz));
    let level = max(log2(texels / PI * view / max(sc.size.y, 1.0)), 0.0);
    return vec4<f32>(textureSampleLevel(picture, sc_repeat, uv, level).rgb, 1.0);
}
```

The texture's `name` is the name the shader uses. The host loads the picture, scales it down to at
most 8192 pixels on a side (or the graphics card's limit), and builds its mipmaps.

## The manifest

`capabilities` must list `"shaders@0.1"`. Each entry of `shaders`:

| Field | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Lowercase letters, digits and `-`, unique in the plugin. The preference names it `<plugin-id>/<id>`. |
| `name` | yes | What people pick it by, 1 to 80 characters. |
| `kind` | yes | `"background"`, the only kind in 0.1. |
| `source` | yes | A `.wgsl` file name in the plugin's folder (lowercase, no folders). |
| `textures` | no | Up to 4 pictures: `{"name": "<wgsl name>", "file": "<file>.png"}` or `.jpg`. |
| `animated` | no | `true`: redrawn about 30 times a second while shown (10 behind another window), with `sc.time` running. `false` (the default): drawn when the view changes, `sc.time` is 0. |

A plugin declares at most 8 shaders. A plugin with shaders and no `runtime` is fine.

## What a shader can use

Write one function:

```wgsl
fn background(px: ScPixel) -> vec4<f32>
```

It returns a colour with alpha. The host clamps it to 0..1 and blends it over the theme's
background, so alpha below 1 lets the theme show through.

**Colours are linear.** The theme colours in `sc` and every texture sample are linear light, not the
sRGB numbers you see in a colour picker, and the colour you return is linear too. The host converts
for the screen. To do maths on screen values, raise to `1.0 / 2.2` first and to `2.2` at the end.

`px: ScPixel`, the pixel being drawn:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `uv` | `vec2<f32>` | 0..1 across the view, from its top left. |
| `position` | `vec2<f32>` | Pixels from the view's top left. |
| `ray` | `vec3<f32>` | The direction this pixel looks along in world space (Z up), unit length. It turns with the camera and ignores zoom and pan. |

`sc: ScHost`, the host's uniforms:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `size` | `vec2<f32>` | The view's size in pixels. |
| `time` | `f32` | Seconds, for an animated shader (comes back to 0 each hour); 0 otherwise. |
| `scale` | `f32` | Pixels per point (the display's scaling). |
| `right`, `up`, `forward` | `vec4<f32>` | The camera's axes in world space (`.xyz`). `right` and `up` are scaled to half the view's width and height at distance 1; `px.ray` is `normalize(forward + x * right + y * up)`. |
| `top`, `bottom` | `vec4<f32>` | The theme's view background at its top and bottom. |
| `accent`, `text` | `vec4<f32>` | The theme's accent and text colours. |
| `dark` | `f32` | 1 for a dark view background, 0 for a light one. |

Samplers: `sc_clamp` (clamps at the edges) and `sc_repeat` (wraps), both linear with mipmaps.
Textures: each `textures` entry is a `texture_2d<f32>` by its `name`.

Constants, helper functions, structs and `var<private>` variables of your own are fine. Names
starting with `sc` and `Sc` belong to the host.

## Rules and limits

The host refuses a shader, at install and at draw time, that:

- is over 64 KiB, or is not UTF-8 WGSL that parses and validates;
- has no `fn background`;
- declares an entry point (`@vertex`, `@fragment`, `@compute`): the host supplies them;
- declares a binding or a `uniform`, `storage` or `workgroup` variable: it reads only `sc`, the two
  samplers and its own textures;
- declares an `override`, or needs a WGSL extension (`enable`).

Errors name the file and the line, for example
`invalid manifest field shaders.dusk: dusk.wgsl: line 3: ...`.

**Loops.** Every pixel gets 1024 loop iterations in total, over all its loops, nested or not. A
loop that reaches the cap ends as if its condition had failed. Write loops with a fixed count that
fits (`for (var i = 0; i < 16; i++)`); a shader never needs the cap, which is there so no shader
can hold the graphics card.

**Sampling in a loop.** Use `textureSampleLevel` inside loops and in code that only some pixels
run. `textureSample` needs every neighbouring pixel to take the same path, which WGSL's uniformity
rules check and refuse there.

**Pictures.** `.png` or `.jpg`, at most 16 MiB each, 4 per shader; scaled down to 8192 pixels on a
side.

**When it fails.** A shader that this graphics card will not compile, or a picture that does not
decode, leaves the theme's background, writes one line in the status bar ("Couldn't draw the
background effect dusk/dusk: ...") and is not tried again until the choice changes or the app
restarts. Nothing is drawn halfway.

## Testing a shader

- `plugin.install {"path": "dusk.zip", "dry_run": true}` checks the package and compiles the
  shader without installing it; a refusal names the line.
- A test copy of SolidCraft started with `SOLIDCRAFT_SETTINGS_DIR` and `SOLIDCRAFT_RECOVERY_DIR`
  set to scratch folders tries a background without touching your own preferences.
- `wgsl-analyzer` or `naga` on the command line catch most mistakes before you zip; they will not
  know `ScPixel` and `sc` unless you paste the declarations from
  [`crates/craft-plugin/src/shader.rs`](../crates/craft-plugin/src/shader.rs) (`PRELUDE`) after
  your source.

## Versions

`shaders@0.1` is version 0.1 of the capability. While it is 0.x, a later minor version may change
it, and SolidCraft then asks you to update the plugin rather than drawing it wrongly. The amendment
in RFC 0015 lists what is planned next (glass panel materials, a previous-frame texture for effects
with memory).
